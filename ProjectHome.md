My initial goal with BetterReader will be simply to duplicate the level of functionality found in most desktop RSS aggregators out currently (or at least the functionality I find useful.)

Once that has been done I hope to extend that functional set with a few key additions which aren't found in any of the FOSS readers out there that I know of.  These extensions will include:

Visual filtering of read items/feeds
Archiving of feed items
Syncing of archived items and item read statuses across multiple installations without a dedicated server
More per feed options than you find in most current apps
And more!
